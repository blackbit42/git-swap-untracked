# git-stash-untracked

This is a simple bash script that helps you to quickly, temporarily move untracked files out of a checked-out git repository.

This is handy e.g. if you're using [etckeeper](https://etckeeper.branchable.com/), you've added config files to /etc that aren't ready for a commit yet and you want to install a package.
